This soundscape narrative includes the flow of my everyday life. It begins with an alarm clock going off, followed by a struggle to get out of bed at six in the morning. After getting up, is the gym, displayed within the narrative by the sounds of weights clanking and being dropped. Following the gym is a shower, before a class. After class, it is stated that I have no idea what is going on, displaying my everyday confusion with chemical engineering classes. After class is the sound of a PlayStation turning on. After my free, gaming time, I go to sleep. This whole day is repeated multiple times, but each time it is sped up. This repetitiveness with increasing speed displays the repetitiveness of life of not only me, but of a lot of college students. My goal was to relate to the listener. With this redundancy of life, I feel as if somebody listening could relate- therefore my goal would be achieved.

Screenshot 1 is to show the repeating
Screenshot 2 is to show how the narrative ends with an extended alarm to show that life continues the same way.

I got all of my sounds off of FreeSound, except the one I recorded myself.
